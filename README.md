## overview
This project are going to be centered in the treating of information, through a neural network
## the AI
I am focused in the development of the neural network from scratch, using popular libraries like..
numpy
matplotlib
pandas

lacking of relevant frameworks like tensorflow or keras inself

## data processed
originaly the data has been characterized for being from humans cognitives senses like
the blood's rhythm, changes in the breathing and so on

## environ
mainly all the project are based in a backend platform such as django is. In the data's perception, the sensors has been considered as a client sending information to the server.

## harware
the most convenient is to get a client module engaged with the sensors, with wifi to being connected to the same network as the server is.
